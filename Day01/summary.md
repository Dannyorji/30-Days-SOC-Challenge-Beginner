# 📅 Day 1 – Introduction to Log Analysis

## 🔍 What I Did

- Opened **Event Viewer** and navigated to:
- Focused on **Event ID 4104**, which records PowerShell script execution.
- Reviewed the `ScriptBlockText` field that shows the actual commands run in PowerShell.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- **Event ID 4104** is crucial for monitoring PowerShell activity.
- The `ScriptBlockText` reveals potentially malicious or suspicious script content.
- PowerShell logs are valuable for threat detection and forensic investigations in a SOC environment.
- Logging must be enabled in the right channels (e.g., PowerShell/Operational) for deep visibility.
